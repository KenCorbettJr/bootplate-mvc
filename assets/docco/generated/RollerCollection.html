<p>It is helpful to abstract your application objects--for clarity's
sake, if nothing else. In this case, we have no special properties
in our collection definition except for <code>model</code>, which must be set.</p>

<p>If you are absolutely certain that you will not extend the kind, and
you prefer not to create an entry for the collection kind, you may
choose not to create one.</p>

<p>If you don't specify a collection kind in other kind definitions,
they will use <code>enyo.Collection</code> by default. This means, however,
that if you want to use a specific model kind with the collection,
you must define the <code>model</code> property on the kind, so that it can be
found during initialization. An <code>enyo.Collection</code> is useless if it
doesn't know what the underlying <code>enyo.Model</code> type is, and it will
let you know if it cannot figure out which model kind to use.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">kind</span><span class="p">({</span>
