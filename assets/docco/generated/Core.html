<p>The <code>main</code> function in Enyo MVC is similar to the <code>main</code> functions
you may have encountered in other languages. Think of it as the
main starting place for the application--all of the source that
should be loaded has been loaded (so all kinds are available in
their namespaces) but the application has not been executed. Use
<code>main</code> to set up any global objects that need to be instantiated
(say, for bindings in views) or to house other necessary logic
(e.g., to load additional libraries). You can do nearly anything in
<code>main</code>, but ideally you'll use it to set up application-scoped
objects and singletons.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">main</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

are sharing a single collection of models.
This is convenient, but can be tricky depending on what you
need to do with the models or with the collection as a whole.
In our case, it's pretty straightforward. We have an
<code>enyo.Collection</code> of models and some additional functionality
specific to the application.</p>

<p>We instantiate <code>App.PanelsController</code> as a global singleton.
This means that, from anywhere within the application, a
string path or hard reference to <code>App.panels</code> will be resolved
to this object.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">panels</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PanelsController</span><span class="p">();</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>We also create a singleton instance of another controller, which is

<p>The <code>enyo.run</code> method lets us queue a function to be run after the
<code>main</code> and <code>enyo.Application</code> startup methods have been run. To use
this method effectively, it is important to understanding the timing
of its execution.</p>

<p>In this case, we want to populate our app with some data in the form
of "scaffolded models" (models based on <code>Scaffold.js</code>). Since
<code>enyo.Application</code> has already been started, the controllers and
views are already set up and listening for events. Adding the new
objects to the collection should trigger some updates, but it turns
out we don't want that to happen for this initial set of data.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="nx">enyo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>We add the scaffolded models using the proxied <code>add</code> method
on our panels controller. Note that we pass an additional
parameter, <code>silent: true</code>, in order to suppress the events
notifying the view of the additions. This is because, by
default, the listener for the addition of models sets the
view's <code>isEditing</code> flag to <code>true</code>. We don't want this to happen,
so we supress these events and arbitrarily issue an event from
the controller to the view.</p>       </section>       <section class="source">         <div class="highlight"><pre>        <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">panels</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Scaffold</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Roller</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">silent</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">});</span></pre></div>       </section>     </section>             <section class="group">       <section class="comments">         <p>We tell the Roller that we're ready by bubbling the <code>onready</code>
